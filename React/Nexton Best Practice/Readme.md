## Using Hooks instead of Classes

  - Classes confuse both people and machines With classes you need to understand binding and the context in which functions are called, which often becomes confusion.

  - Often with classes Mutually unrelated code often ends up together or related code tends to be split apart, it becomes more and more difficult to maintain. An example of such a case is event listeners, where you add listeners in componentDidMount and remove them in componentWillUnmount . Hooks let you combine these two

  - Hooks are a new addition to React in version 16.8 that allows you use state and other React features, like lifecycle methods, without writing a class.

  - Hooks let you always use functions instead of having to constantly switch between functions, classes, higher-order components, and render props.

  - Hooks allow us to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.

##  Keep components small and function-specific
- As we all know, with React, it’s possible to have huge components that execute a number of tasks. But a better way to design components is to keep them small, so that one component corresponds to one function.

- Ideally, a single component should render a specific bit of your page or modify a particular behavior. There are many advantages to this.

##  Reusability is important
- By sticking to the rule of one function = one component, we can improve the reusability of components. We should skip trying to build a new component for a function if there already exists a component for that function.

## DRY your code

- You can achieve this by scrutinizing the code for patterns and similarities. If you find any, it’s possible you’re repeating code and there’s scope to eliminate duplication. Most likely, a bit of rewriting can make it more concise.

```jsx

const buttons = ['facebook', 'twitter', 'youtube'];

return (
  <div>
    {
      buttons.map( (button) => {
        return (
          <IconButton
            onClick={doStuff( button )}
            iconClass={button}
          />
        );
      } )
    }
  </div>
);
    
```
## Components Name

- It’s a good practice to name a component after the function that it executes so that it’s easily recognizable.

- For example, ```ProductTable``` – it conveys instantly what the component does. On the other hand, if we name the component based on the need for the code, it can be confuse at a future point of time.

## Testing Code

- The code we write should behave as expected, and be testable easily and quickly. It’s a good practice to name your test files identical to the source files with a ```.test``` suffix. It’ll then be easy to find the test files.

## File Structure

- We organize all the files by function type ```components```, ```actions```, ```services```.


### Components Structure
- If there’s any small component used by a particular component only, it makes sense to keep these smaller components all together within that component folder. The hierarchy will then be easy to understand – large components have their own folder and all their smaller parts are split into sub-folders. This way, we can easily extract code to any other project or even modify the code whenever we want.
